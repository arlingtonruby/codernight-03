# design note: I have waffled back and forth as to whether the global
# initializers should run before the environment-specific one in the
# few lines above.  I've come to think that the environment-specific one
# may set some configuration that is used later in the global init,
# so this is the way it works now.  Feel free to change if your situation
# is different than mine.

require_all File.expand_path('app/models')
# require_all File.expand_path('app/mailers')
